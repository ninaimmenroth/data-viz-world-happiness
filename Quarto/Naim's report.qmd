## Background

### About the World Happiness Report

The World Happiness Report (WHR) is a reflection of the worldwide evaluation of happiness and well-being across 170 countries (World Happiness Report). WHR measures the happiness state on a yearly basis and emphasizes the need for incorporating well-being factors in government policy making.

The report is a collaboration of Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the United Nation's Sustainable Development Solutions Network and the WHR's Editorial Board. The first report was released in the year 2012.

### Understanding the Happiness Score

Happiness scores are measured based on the survey responses from the Gallup World Poll (World Happiness Report). The evaluation from the Gallup World Poll primarily stems from answers of the survey questions and the Cantril Ladder score. The poll comprises of more than 100 questions that includes global questions and region-specific topics regarding several well-being areas. Those well-being areas include law and order, good jobs, well-being, food and shelter, institutions and infrastructure, and brain gain (Wikipedia 2024). Gallup typically collects for a sample size of 1,000 people for each country annually.

Next, the Cantril Ladder score is a score range of 0 to 10, where 0 being the worst well-being condition and 10 being the best well-being condition. The Cantril Ladder asks to rate the current state of the respondents' well-being between 0 and 10. The country happiness rankings are representative from three year samples of the poll. The ladder score is the overall national **happiness score**. Sometimes, the term "*life evaluation*" is used interchangeably with happiness score.

### 6 Explanatory Variables

In Figure 2.1 of the World Happiness Report 2024, the happiness score or life evaluation is indicated for each country in the entire dataset.

Six explanatory variables are derived from the poll answers and the estimations of those six variables associating with the happiness score would explain the variation across different countries. Those variables include Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom, corruption and generosity. Definitions of those variables will be explained in the Data section of this report.

According to the report, the sub-bars do not influence the total score reported for each country (World Happiness Report 2024), however they merely indicate the country's overall score explained by each of the six explanatory variables (World Happiness Report). The sub-bars are measured by multiplying average data for the period of the last 3 years for each of those variables. For the 2024 report, the national average for 2021-2023 are calculated for the display of the sub-bars for each variable.

# Software and Tools

For the analysis, RStudio Desktop environment was used. The following packages were used for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

-   `here`

-   `tidyverse`

-   `GGally`

-   `grid`

-   `randomForest`

Functions from these packages were used to conduct the analysis, with the following functions being particularly important:

-   `randomForest`

    `randomForest` implements Breiman's random forest algorithm for classification and regression. Random subsets of data are used when training a random forest model. From the model evaluation, important features can be determined.

# Data

## World Happiness Report Data 2015-2023

The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle datasets collection, where it includes the World Happiness Report data between 2015 and 2023. The dataset contains the country name, region name, national happiness score, and the other explanatory factors (Islam 2023). Those explanatory factors are GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. The variables in the dataset represent socio-economic and well-being statuses from the individuals who participated in the Gallup World Poll in that duration.

## World Happiness Report 2024 Chapter 2 Appendix

The dataset for the Chapter Appendix comes from the survey responses of the Gallup World Poll from 2005 and 2023. The dataset contains demographical information, namely country name and region name, and numerical information for GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity and perceptions of corruption. Contrary to the previous dataset, the GDP per capita and healthy life expentancy columns is in its true average representation and not adjusted for the life evaluation score.

## Variable Definitions

**Happiness score** is a measure of subjective well-being (SWB) in the Gallup World Poll (GWP) covering years from 2005/06 to 2023. Unless stated otherwise, it is the national average response to the question of life evaluations. The question in the poll that directly measures the score is “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best
possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”

This measure is also referred to as Cantril life ladder.

**GDP per capita** is the purchasing power parity at 2017 constant international dollar prices from World Development Indicators. When the latest GDP per capita is not available as of a certain date of the year, country-specific forecasts of real GDP growth from the Economic Outlook is used for average calculation. If it is unavailable from the Economic Outlook, then forecasts from the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects are utilized.

**Healthy Life Expectancy** (LSE) at birth are based on the Global Health Observatory data by the World Health Organization (WHO).

**Social support** represents the national average of the ability to rely on someone in times of trouble and the representation is in binary responses (either 0 or 1). In the Gallup World Poll, the binary response is collected from the question "If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?".

**Freedom** represents the ability to make life decisions from the Gallup World Poll question "Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?".

**Generosity** is the national average of answers to the Gallup World Poll question "Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?".

**Corruption** is the perceptive measure from the following 2 questions in the Gallup World Poll. Those questions are "Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?" and "Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?".

**Positive affect** is defined as the average of three positive affect measures in the GWP: laugh, enjoyment and doing interesting things in the Gallup World Poll.

These measures are the responses to the following three questions, respectively:

-   “Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?”

-   “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Enjoyment?”

-   “Did you learn or do something interesting yesterday?”

**Negative affect** is defined as the average of three negative affect measures in the GWP. They are worry, sadness and anger.

Those emotional states are respective responses to the following questions:

-   “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Worry?”

-   “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Sadness?”

-   “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Anger?”

**Dystopia** is an imaginary country that has the world’s least-happy people. The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key variables, thus allowing each sub-bar to be of positive (or zero, in six instances) width. The lowest scores observed for the six key variables, therefore, characterize Dystopia.
