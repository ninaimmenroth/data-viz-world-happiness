## Background

### About the World Happiness Report

The World Happiness Report (WHR) is a reflection of the worldwide evaluation of happiness and well-being across 170 countries (World Happiness Report). WHR measures the happiness state on a yearly basis and emphasizes the need for incorporating well-being factors in government policy making.

The report is a collaboration of Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the United Nation's Sustainable Development Solutions Network and the WHR's Editorial Board. The first report was released in the year 2012.

### Understanding the Happiness Score

Happiness scores are measured based on the survey responses from the Gallup World Poll (World Happiness Report). The evaluation from the Gallup World Poll primarily stems from answers of the survey questions and the Cantril Ladder score. The poll comprises of more than 100 questions that includes global questions and region-specific topics regarding several well-being areas. Those well-being areas include law and order, good jobs, well-being, food and shelter, institutions and infrastructure, and brain gain (Wikipedia 2024). Gallup typically collects for a sample size of 1,000 people for each country annually.

Next, the Cantril Ladder score is a score range of 0 to 10, where 0 being the worst well-being condition and 10 being the best well-being condition. The Cantril Ladder asks to rate the current state of the respondents' well-being between 0 and 10. The country happiness rankings are representative from three year samples of the poll.

Six explanatory variables are derived from the poll answers and the estimations of those six variables associating with the happiness score would explain the variation across different countries. Those variables include Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom, corruption and generosity.

### 6 Explanatory Variables

In Figure 2.1 of the World Happiness Report 2024, the happiness score or life evaluation is indicated for each country in the entire dataset.

According to the report, the sub-bars do not influence the total score reported for each country (World Happiness Report 2024), however they merely indicate the country's overall score explained by each of the six explanatory variables (World Happiness Report). The sub-bars are measured by multiplying average data for the period of the last 3 years for each of those variables. For the 2024 report, the national average for 2021-2023 are calculated for the display of the sub-bars for each variable.

**GDP per capita** is the purchasing power parity at 2017 constant international dollar prices from World Development Indicators. When the latest GDP per capita is not available as of a certain date of the year, country-specific forecasts of real GDP growth from the Economic Outlook is used for average calculation. If it is unavailable from the Economic Outlook, then forecasts from the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects are utilized.

**Healthy Life Expectancy** (LSE) at birth are based on the Global Health Observatory data by the World Health Organization (WHO).

**Social support** represents the national average of the ability to rely on someone in times of trouble and the representation is in binary responses (either 0 or 1). In the Gallup World Poll, the binary response is collected from the question "If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?"

**Freedom** represents the ability to make life decisions from the Gallup World Poll question "Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?"

**Generosity** is the national average of answers to the Gallup World Poll question "Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?"

**Corruption** is the perceptive measure from the following 2 questions in the Gallup World Poll. Those questions are "Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?" and "Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?".
